## About

A clone of the system Calculator app on iOS. 

## Why?

This project serves 2 main purposes:

1. as an exercise in building a simple mobile app from scratch. 
* I picked something simple so that I could finish the project in a resonable amount of time, but I also wanted to experience some of the complexity that's part of a real application. 
That's why I'm trying to achieve the same behaviour and fit-and-finish of the system app.
2. to document parts of the development process.
* This is mainly my design and implementation decisions for some of the essential features in the app.
* But also things that I learnt during this project or found interesting (e.g. test-driven development).
